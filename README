NEED TO CHANGE (EXISTING) TIME CALCULATIONS TO USE QBTIME

2.19.14
everything is working nicely, insert conversion rate is up and running, though i have doubts
about how that will interact with inserting the time calculations. probably just have to do that before I insert the conversion rate etc. gross nested if statements incoming.	
2.18.14
about to do some serious edits. tyreporter is working for the most part.
to do list for the evening includes:

1. merge qbreporter and tyreporter
2. implement get qbTime
3. implement conversion calculations for each opportunity
4. set up for multiple files being run.

good luck amirite?

and honestly qbReporter really needs to be converted to use dictionaries, its going to be slow as hell. what do...


2.3.14
need to add things to implement tayrex data. also use python dictionaries instead of lists. may implement today.
