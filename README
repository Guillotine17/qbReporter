ABOUT: qb reporter takes input from the qb reports and organizes it by user and client, will integrate data from tayrex soon.

2.18.14
about to do some serious edits. tyreporter is working for the most part.
to do list for the evening includes:

1. merge qbreporter and tyreporter
2. implement get qbTime
3. implement conversion calculations for each opportunity
4. set up for multiple files being run.

good luck amirite?

and honestly qbReporter really needs to be converted to use dictionaries, its going to be slow as hell. what do...
